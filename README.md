## Purpose
The purpose of the DimaEd landing page project was twofold: firstly, to challenge and strengthen my front-end development skills by tackling a comprehensive solo project, and secondly, to create a visually engaging portfolio piece that reflects my growth and proficiency in crafting user-friendly interfaces. Inspired by Udemy, this endeavor was driven by a personal commitment to overcome discomfort with front-end work, pushing boundaries to create an impactful and visually appealing representation of a potential online learning platform.

## Challenges

- Challenges faced during development: As a solo developer, managing time effectively while maintaining simplicity was a key challenge. Additionally, ensuring that the landing page resonated with users required a fine balance between content and design.

 - Solutions implemented: Streamlining the design process, focusing on key features, and incorporating visual storytelling were instrumental in overcoming these challenges.
