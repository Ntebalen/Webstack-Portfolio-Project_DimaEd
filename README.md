The purpose of the DimaEd landing page project was twofold: firstly, to challenge and strengthen my front-end development skills by tackling a comprehensive solo project, and secondly, to create a visually engaging portfolio piece that reflects my growth and proficiency in crafting user-friendly interfaces. Inspired by Udemy, this endeavor was driven by a personal commitment to overcome discomfort with front-end work, pushing boundaries to create an impactful and visually appealing representation of a potential online learning platform.

## Challenges
